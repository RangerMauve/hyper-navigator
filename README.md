# hyper-navigator
A simple web app for browsing `hyper` repositories.

## TODO:

- Use Agregore's fetch interface for everything
- Store URL you want to view in the querystring
- Switch between iframe view and raw text view
- Raw text view is just a `<textarea>` with the contents
- Detect if the drive is writable to make the text editable / have a save button
- Detect directories and show the file list in editing
- If writable, add delete button to files / in directory listings
- Drag and drop for file uploads?
